                <br><br> ☛ After hitting a six in the third Test against England in Southampton, Dhoni completed 50 sixes as a captain, an Indian record. 
                <br><br> ☛ Dhoni's 183* against Sri Lanka in 2005 is the highest score by a wicket-keeper.
                <br><br> ☛ Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were involved in a partnership of 100 not out against Sri Lanka, which is India's highest eighth wicket partnership in ODIs.
